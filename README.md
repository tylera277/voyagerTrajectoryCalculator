# voyagerTrajectoryCalculator

Second attempt at trying to calculate when another Voyager probe-like trip could happen again in the solar system. This attempt will be more mathematical in nature and less brute force I believe. This will take longer for me to do but should be effective in giving me the answer that I seek. 

Step 1: Code a simple Lambert's problem solver.

Step 2: Solve a simple intersection problem, say from the Earth to Jupiter. Plot it in matplotlib as well.

Step 3: Figure out this stuff about v-infinity matching and try to figure out how to chain these slingshots together. Try initially just to get a slingshot from Jupiter to Saturn working.
